                Our hot stone massage is good for long-term joint and muscle
                pain, muscle spasms, and relief of tension. The heat of the
                stones is both deeply relaxing for you, and warming, which
                allows your therapist to work more deeply, and more quickly into
                tight muscles.

              Once you arrive at Radiance, your therapist will greet you and ask
              you some questions about your reasons for taking a massage, whilst
              you will fill out a Massage Consultation Form (a quick survey
              where you record any important medical history, pain areas,
              injuries and any other physical conditions we should know about).
              Most importantly, when your massage therapist reviews the Massage
              Consultation form with you, they will be quickly able to: Ensure
              you are safe and healthy to receive massage. Understand what you
              want from the session, and also your preferences on the level of
              pressure you would like during your massage. If you don’t know,
              they will advise, it’s their job! Identify any specific areas of
              your body in pain or needing specific attention during your
              massage, whilst also checking any areas you do not want massaged.

              Your massage therapist will take you to a quiet, comfortable
              treatment room where a padded massage bed and clean sheets will
              have been prepared. The Massage Therapist will tell you what
              position to lie in on the table, and which sheets to cover
              yourself with, before they then leave the room and wait outside to
              allow you to undress to your own personal comfort.

            <p class="text_3 slide-down">
              You will always be covered with the top sheet during your massage
              session. The process your massage therapist will follow is to only
              uncover the part of the body they are working on, ensuring that
              your modesty is 100% respected 100% of the time.

            <p class="text_4 slide-down">
              Once ur treatment is finished, your therapist will leave the room
              to let you re dress and wait outside the room with a glass of
              water. Our treatments range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Each
              treatment will require clients to complete a consultation form
              prior to any treatment. We look forward to seeing you! If you have
              any questions about the etiquette during a massage, one of our
              therapists will be happy to answer all your queries in as much
              detail or privacy as you require, either on the phone or in person
