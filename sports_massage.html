            Often taken by those actively engaged in hard physical work and
            activity, or regular sport (including all top sports people). This
            deeper muscle massage is typically associated with the prevention
            and treatment of injury, strains, and sprains.

            Our therapists will help by concentrating your treatment to suit
            your particular body needs. Sports massage can improve mental
            alertness, muscle pain, and is also an excellent follow on from
            specialist work like physiotherapy or osteopathy.

                tight muscles.

              Once you arrive at Radiance, your therapist will greet you and ask
              you some questions about your reasons for taking a massage, whilst
              you will fill out a Massage Consultation Form (a quick survey
              where you record any important medical history, pain areas,
              injuries and any other physical conditions we should know about).
              Most importantly, when your massage therapist reviews the Massage
              Consultation form with you, they will be quickly able to: Ensure
              you are safe and healthy to receive massage. Understand what you
              want from the session, and also your preferences on the level of
              pressure you would like during your massage. If you don’t know,
              they will advise, it’s their job! Identify any specific areas of
              your body in pain or needing specific attention during your
              massage, whilst also checking any areas you do not want massaged.

              position to lie in on the table, and which sheets to cover
              yourself with, before they then leave the room and wait outside to
              allow you to undress to your own personal comfort.

              You will always be covered with the top sheet during your massage

              uncover the part of the body they are working on, ensuring that
              your modesty is 100% respected 100% of the time.

              overhead speakers, but can be turned down if you prefer. The same
              for our lighting, which will be turned down during the session,
              but can be raised if you ask. It’s easy!
